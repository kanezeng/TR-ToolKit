# Translation Engineering Tool Kit

This is a set of light weight APIs provided for people who are doing **g11n/i18n/l10n** engineering related tasks.

## It contains the following features: 

1. Doing native2ascii conversion.
2. File encoding conversion.
3. Extract translatable strings from specified file.
4. Calculate the word count of translatable strings.
5. Calculate the difference between two given strings.
6. more features will be added from time to time...
7. Export translatable strings to a XLIFF file.

## What I am thinking now:

1. TM (Translation Memory) management
3. Language files creation.
